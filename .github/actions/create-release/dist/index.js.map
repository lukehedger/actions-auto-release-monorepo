working directory. Checks if path is absolute or\n * relative. If the path is relative, this function checks if the path is\n * relative to symlink or relative to current working directory. This is an\n * initiative to find a smarter `srcpath` to supply when building symlinks.\n * This allows you to determine which path to use out of one of three possible\n * types of source paths. The first is an absolute path. This is detected by\n * `path.isAbsolute()`. When an absolute path is provided, it is checked to\n * see if it exists. If it does it's used, if not an error is returned\n * (callback)/ thrown (sync). The other two options for `srcpath` are a\n * relative url. By default Node's `fs.symlink` works by creating a symlink\n * using `dstpath` and expects the `srcpath` to be relative to the newly\n * created symlink. If you provide a `srcpath` that does not exist on the file\n * system it results in a broken symlink. To minimize this, the function\n * checks to see if the 'relative to symlink' source file exists, and if it\n * does it will use it. If it does not, it checks if there's a file that\n * exists that is relative to the current working directory, if does its used.\n * This preserves the expectations of the original fs.symlink spec and adds\n * the ability to pass in `relative to current working direcotry` paths.\n */\n\nfunction symlinkPaths (srcpath, dstpath, callback) {\n  if (path.isAbsolute(srcpath)) {\n    return fs.lstat(srcpath, (err) => {\n      if (err) {\n        err.message = err.message.replace('lstat', 'ensureSymlink')\n        return callback(err)\n      }\n      return callback(null, {\n        'toCwd': srcpath,\n        'toDst': srcpath\n      })\n    })\n  } else {\n    const dstdir = path.dirname(dstpath)\n    const relativeToDst = path.join(dstdir, srcpath)\n    return pathExists(relativeToDst, (err, exists) => {\n      if (err) return callback(err)\n      if (exists) {\n        return callback(null, {\n          'toCwd': relativeToDst,\n          'toDst': srcpath\n        })\n      } else {\n        return fs.lstat(srcpath, (err) => {\n          if (err) {\n            err.message = err.message.replace('lstat', 'ensureSymlink')\n            return callback(err)\n          }\n          return callback(null, {\n            'toCwd': srcpath,\n            'toDst': path.relative(dstdir, srcpath)\n          })\n        })\n      }\n    })\n  }\n}\n\nfunction symlinkPathsSync (srcpath, dstpath) {\n  let exists\n  if (path.isAbsolute(srcpath)) {\n    exists = fs.existsSync(srcpath)\n    if (!exists) throw new Error('absolute srcpath does not exist')\n    return {\n      'toCwd': srcpath,\n      'toDst': srcpath\n    }\n  } else {\n    const dstdir = path.dirname(dstpath)\n    const relativeToDst = path.join(dstdir, srcpath)\n    exists = fs.existsSync(relativeToDst)\n    if (exists) {\n      return {\n        'toCwd': relativeToDst,\n        'toDst': srcpath\n      }\n    } else {\n      exists = fs.existsSync(srcpath)\n      if (!exists) throw new Error('relative srcpath does not exist')\n      return {\n        'toCwd': srcpath,\n        'toDst': path.relative(dstdir, srcpath)\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nmodule.exports = {\n  symlinkPaths,\n  symlinkPathsSync\n}\n","'use strict'\n\nconst fs = require('graceful-fs')\n\nfunction symlinkType (srcpath, type, callback) {\n  callback = (typeof type === 'function') ? type : callback\n  type = (typeof type === 'function') ? false : type\n  if (type) return callback(null, type)\n  fs.lstat(srcpath, (err, stats) => {\n    if (err) return callback(null, 'file')\n    type = (stats && stats.isDirectory()) ?

Sometimes it's called a \"filter\",\n// but that's not a great name for it, since that implies a thing where\n// some bits pass through, and others are simply ignored.  (That would\n// be a valid example of a transform, of course.)\n//\n// While the output is causally related to the input, it's not a\n// necessarily symmetric or synchronous transformation.  For example,\n// a zlib stream might take multiple plain-text writes(), and then\n// emit a single compressed chunk some time in the future.\n//\n// Here's how this works:\n//\n// The Transform stream has all the aspects of the readable and writable\n// stream classes.  When you write(chunk), that calls _write(chunk,cb)\n// internally, and returns false if there's a lot of pending writes\n// buffered up.  When you call read(), that calls _read(n) until\n// there's enough pending readable data buffered up.\n//\n// In a transform stream, the written data is placed in a buffer.  When\n// _read(n) is called, it transforms the queued up data, calling the\n// buffered _write cb's as it consumes chunks.  If consuming a single\n// written chunk would result in multiple output chunks, then the first\n// outputted bit calls the readcb, and subsequent chunks just go into\n// the read buffer, and will cause it to emit 'readable' if necessary.\n//\n// This way, back-pressure is actually determined by the reading side,\n// since _read has to be called to start processing a new chunk.  However,\n// a pathological inflate type of transform can cause excessive buffering\n// here.  For example, imagine a stream where every byte of input is\n// interpreted as an integer from 0-255, and then results in that many\n// bytes of output.  Writing the 4 bytes {ff,ff,ff,ff} would result in\n// 1kb of data being output.  In this case, you could write a very small\n// amount of input, and end up with a very large amount of output.  In\n// such a pathological inflating mechanism, there'd be no way to tell\n// the system to stop doing the transform.  A single 4MB write could\n// cause the system to run out of memory.\n//\n// However, even in such a pathological case, only a single written chunk\n// would be consumed, and then the rest would wait (un-transformed) until\n// the results of the previous transformed chunk were consumed.\n\nmodule.exports = Transform;\n\nvar Duplex = require('./_stream_duplex');\n\n/*<replacement>*/\nvar util = require('core-util-is');\nutil.inherits = require('inherits');\n/*</replacement>*/\n\nutil.inherits(Transform, Duplex);\n\n\nfunction TransformState(options, stream) {\n  this.afterTransform = function(er, data) {\n    return afterTransform(stream, er, data);\n  };\n\n  this.needTransform = false;\n  this.transforming = false;\n  this.writecb = null;\n  this.writechunk = null;\n}\n\nfunction afterTransform(stream, er, data) {\n  var ts = stream._transformState;\n  ts.transforming = false;\n\n  var cb = ts.writecb;\n\n  if (!cb)\n    return stream.emit('error', new Error('no writecb in Transform class'));\n\n  ts.writechunk = null;\n  ts.writecb = null;\n\n  if (!util.isNullOrUndefined(data))\n    stream.push(data);\n\n  if (cb)\n    cb(er);\n\n  var rs = stream._readableState;\n  rs.reading = false;\n  if (rs.needReadable || rs.length < rs.highWaterMark) {\n    stream._read(rs.highWaterMark);\n  }\n}\n\n\nfunction Transform(options) {\n  if (!(this instanceof Transform))\n    return new Transform(options);\n\n  Duplex.call(this, options);\n\n  this._transformState = new TransformState(options, this);\n\n  // when the writable side finishes, then flush out anything remaining.\n  var stream = this;\n\n  // start out asking for a readable event once data is transformed.\n  this._readableState.needReadable = true;\n\n  // we have implemented the _read method, and done the other things\n  // that Readable wants before the first _read call, so unset the\n  // sync guard flag.\n  this._readableState.sync = false;\n\n  this.once('prefinish', function() {\n    if (util.isFunction(this._flush))\n      this._flush(function(er) {\n        done(stream, er);\n      });\n    else\n      done(stream);\n  });\n}\n\nTransform.prototype.push = function(chunk, encoding) {\n  this._transformState.needTransform = false;\n  return Duplex.prototype.push.call(this, chunk, encoding);\n};\n\n// This is the part where you do stuff!\n// override this function in implementation classes.\n// 'chunk' is an input chunk.\n//\n// Call `push(newChunk)` to pass along transformed output\n// to the readable side.
